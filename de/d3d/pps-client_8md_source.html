However, GPS reception is available everywhere and in conjunction with a daemon like PPS-Client can be used for that purpose now. Indeed, an Internet search found commercial GPS repeaters that can bring GPS reception indoors with local coverage up to at least 30 meters.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00032"></a><span class="lineno">   32</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00033"></a><span class="lineno">   33</span>&#160;The ability to time synchronize multiple computers with microsecond accuracy is particularly important for small embedded processors like the RPi that can be used to used to construct distributed systems with a large number of individual cores. This works very well when the individual RPis are time synchronized because that makes applications possible that would otherwise be difficult or impractical. One example is a multiple video camera system that synchronizes the video frames from the individual RPis each handling a different camera. In this kind of application a robot with twin cameras for eyes could easily synchronize the cameras from the system time on each RPi.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00034"></a><span class="lineno">   34</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00035"></a><span class="lineno">   35</span>&#160;There are other uses for time synchronized computers: Network administrators might find it useful to have the possibility of making one-way, single-path time measurements of network delays. That becomes possible if the computers at the endpoints are accurately synchronized to GPS time - which is rarely the case at present. Also, certain kinds of scientific applications require accurate synchronization to a GSP clock. One sometimes of interest to amateur astronomers is [occultation timing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation). Another is collection of distributed seismic data with remote computers in the study of earthquakes or for substratum mapping. If computers were routinely provided with microsecond-accuracy timekeeping other applications would soon appear.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00036"></a><span class="lineno">   36</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00037"></a><span class="lineno">   37</span>&#160;# How To Do High Accuracy Timekeeping {#how-to-do-high-accuracy-timekeeping}</div><div class="line"><a name="l00038"></a><span class="lineno">   38</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00039"></a><span class="lineno">   39</span>&#160;The PPS-Client daemon is implemented as a [proportional-integral (PI) controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) (a.k.a. type 2 Servo) with proportional and integral feedback provided each second but with the value of the integral feedback adjusted once per minute. The PI controller model provides a view of time synchronization as a linear feedback system in which gain coefficients can be adjusted to provide a good compromise among stability, transient response and amount of noise introduced in the error signal. </div><div class="line"><a name="l00040"></a><span class="lineno">   40</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00041"></a><span class="lineno">   41</span>&#160;The error signal is the time difference between the one-second interval provided by a PPS signal and the length of the second reported by the system clock. The noise of concern is the second-to-second variation in time reported by the system because of the corresponding variation of system delay in responding to the PPS interrupt. This variable component of the delay, referred to as jitter, is a combination of clock oscillator jitter, PPS signal jitter and system latency in responding the the interrupt.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00042"></a><span class="lineno">   42</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00043"></a><span class="lineno">   43</span>&#160;Because the error signal has jitter and is being used to control synchronization, the jitter component has the effect of a **false error signal** that causes the time and frequency synchronization to fluctuate as the controller attempts to follow the jitter. The conventional approach to reducing jitter is to low-pass or median filter the error signal. But filtering has the serious disadvantage that reduction of the jitter must be traded off against time delay introduced by the filter. Additional time delay in the feedback loop inevitably degrades controller performance. The PPS-Client program uses a much better technique that introduces **no** delay. To reduce the jitter, the time values returned by the system are passed through a hard limiter that clips them before applying them as time corrections.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00044"></a><span class="lineno">   44</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00045"></a><span class="lineno">   45</span>&#160;Indeed, individual time corrections constitute jitter added to a very small time correction. Consequently, each individual correction is mostly jitter and thus is wrong by nearly the amount that it deviates from zero. Because of that, the limiting employed in this system clips the maximum time corrections when the controller has fully stabilized to the time resolution of the system clock, 1 microsecond.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00046"></a><span class="lineno">   46</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00047"></a><span class="lineno">   47</span>&#160;It might seem that such extreme limiting would remove the desired error signal along with the noise. But that doesn&#39;t happen because the true time error is a slowly varying quasi-stationary (DC) level. Limiting only slices off the dynamic (AC) component of the error signal. The DC component remains. (To see what limiting does see Figures 3, 4, and 5 and the relevant discussion.) If the jitter were not limited, the controller would make the sum of the positive and negative jitter zero. That would be undesirable even after filtering because the noise has significant components in time periods that extend to well beyond one minute. Filtering would remove noise only for time intervals within the cut-off region of the filter. Longer period noise would remain. </div><div class="line"><a name="l00048"></a><span class="lineno">   48</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00049"></a><span class="lineno">   49</span>&#160;On the other hand, instead of zeroing the **sum** of negative and positive jitter and thereby allowing the difference to be introduced as noise, hard limiting causes the controller to make the **number** of positive and negative excursions to be equal around zero. That happens because the clipped positive and negative amplitudes are identical (1 microsecond). Thus, making the sum zero makes the count equal. As a result, the varying magnitude of the jitter around the control point is ignored and the reported time delay of the PPS rising edge adjusts to its median value, i.e., the delay at which there were as many shorter as longer reported delays over the previous minute.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00050"></a><span class="lineno">   50</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00051"></a><span class="lineno">   51</span>&#160;The only disadvantage of hard limiting is that it reduces the amount of time correction that can be applied each each second. But that limitation is easily circumvented by allowing the hard limit level to track the amount of required time correction. This insures that the hard limit level does not prevent larger time corrections when they are necessary.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00052"></a><span class="lineno">   52</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00053"></a><span class="lineno">   53</span>&#160;As described, hard limiting removes the error that would be introduced by the magnitude of jitter around the control point. However noise that is outside the control region of the controller, that is, noise with a period appreciably longer than one minute would remain. The time delay corresponding to PPS interrupt latency contains noise of that kind which appears as a slow variation in the latency which changes with processor activity (and flicker noise). This latency is corrected in PPS-Client by **measuring and compensating for** the system latency with a variable called `sysDelay`. The `sysDelay` value directly determines the control point of the controller because the time of the roll over of the second is determined as the reported time of the interrupt **minus** the value of `sysDelay`.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00054"></a><span class="lineno">   54</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00055"></a><span class="lineno">   55</span>&#160;## Noise {#noise}</div><div class="line"><a name="l00056"></a><span class="lineno">   56</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00057"></a><span class="lineno">   57</span>&#160;As an introduction to how PPS-Client corrects for the varying value of system latency with `sysDelay`, it is useful to consider the nature of the noise in more detail because measurements revealed that system latency is a combination of a static **constant component** and three identifiable noise components.

These PPS timestamps are recorded by a kernel device driver, `pps-gps-io.ko`, that was specifically designed to record the timestamps as closely as possible to when the processor responded to the PPS interrupts. This is important because the time at which the system responded to the interrupt minus the time at which it actually toggled the input pin is the interrupt delay that must be compensated by the control point constant, `G.sysDelay`, and this delay must correspond as accurately as possible to that time difference in order to reduce the uncertainty of the delay value.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00153"></a><span class="lineno">  153</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00154"></a><span class="lineno">  154</span>&#160;The `makeTimeCorrection()` routine is the central controller routine and it waits in the timer loop of the function, `waitForPPS()` and inside the `readPPS_SetTime()` routine, until a PPS timestamp becomes available from the PPS-Client device driver.

If it&#39;s not spike noise, the average time slew, `G.avgSlew` is updated by `G.rawError`. The `G.avgSlew` value along with the average time correction up to the current second, `G.avgCorrection`, determines the current hard limit value that will be applied in the final noise removal routine, `clampJitter()`.

In general, proportional feedback is correcting the time by the (gain-scaled and limited) time error measured each second. The integral feedback is updated each minute with the average of the time corrections over the previous minute. As the integral is formed the result is to move the frequency offset minute by minute towards synchronization. It should be clear that in any minute where the system clock frequency is not perfectly in sync with the PPS, the average length of the second will be either longer or shorter than one second. For example, if the average length of the second differed by 1 microsecond from the true length of the second, that would indicate that the system clock was in error by 1 part per million, in which case an adjustment of the frequency offset by 1 ppm might be expected. </div><div class="line"><a name="l00187"></a><span class="lineno">  187</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00188"></a><span class="lineno">  188</span>&#160;![Offsets to 300 secs](pps-offsets-to-300.png)</div><div class="line"><a name="l00189"></a><span class="lineno">  189</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00190"></a><span class="lineno">  190</span>&#160;Now notice that, in the minute between sequence number 120 and 180, there is a clearly visible positive bias in the time correction values. Averaging those time corrections (literally adding them from the figure and dividing by 60), gets a 3.22 microsecond average bias indicating that the system clock is in error by 3.22 parts per million over that minute. However, in the next minute (between 180 and 240), the frequency offset is changed by only about 1.8 ppm. In other words, frequency offset change is only about 0.55 of the amount needed to do a full frequency correction and, moreover, it is easily verified that same fractional correction is made in every succeeding minute. </div><div class="line"><a name="l00191"></a><span class="lineno">  191</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00192"></a><span class="lineno">  192</span>&#160;The 0.55 fractional adjustment is the damping ratio fixed by the integral gain of the PI controller.

The reason is that the correction is always made too late. It would have been correct for the minute in which it was measured but by the time it has been measured it can only be an estimate for the next minute. If the estimate is even slightly too large then the estimation error will be integrated along with the estimate and will become progressively larger in each succeeding minute until the result is an oscillation of the frequency around its stable value. The design decision is that, considering noise and other system uncertainties, it is better to have the controller acquire more slowly with a lower damping value than to risk oscillation with a higher value.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00195"></a><span class="lineno">  195</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00196"></a><span class="lineno">  196</span>&#160;Once the controller has acquired, it continues to average the time errors that occurred over the past minute and to apply the scaled integral of the average as the frequency correction for the next minute. So theoretically the controller never acquires. Rather it is constantly chasing the value to be acquired with a somewhat low estimate of that value. This seems to argue for a [Zeno&#39;s paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes). In practice, however, the difference between the estimate and the target value soon drops below the noise level so that any practical measurement would indicate that the controller had, indeed, acquired.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00197"></a><span class="lineno">  197</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00198"></a><span class="lineno">  198</span>&#160;The startup transient in Figure 3 is the largest adjustment in frequency the controller ever needs to make and in order to make that adjustment relatively large time corrections are necessary.

In this case a full processor load (100% usage on all four cores) was suddenly applied at sequence number 1900. The loading raised the processor temperature causing a total shift in frequency offset of about 1.7 ppm from onset to a stable value near sequence number 2500. The time corrections increased to 2 microseconds only in the region of steepest ascent. Since the transients caused by extreme load changes occur infrequently, it is likely that a time correction more than 1 microsecond would only occasionally occur in normal operation. Moreover it is unlikely that a precision time measurement would be required simultaneously with the onset of full processor load.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00203"></a><span class="lineno">  203</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00204"></a><span class="lineno">  204</span>&#160;![PPS offsets to Stress](pps-offsets-stress.png)</div><div class="line"><a name="l00205"></a><span class="lineno">  205</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00206"></a><span class="lineno">  206</span>&#160;## Error Handling {#error-handling}</div><div class="line"><a name="l00207"></a><span class="lineno">  207</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00208"></a><span class="lineno">  208</span>&#160;All trapped errors are reported to the log file `/var/log/pps-client.log`.

Since all tests will be the result of evaluating the peaks of noise distributions over a large number of trials, the widening of the distribution will have a negligible effect.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00337"></a><span class="lineno">  337</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00338"></a><span class="lineno">  338</span>&#160;### The pulse-generator Utility {#the-pulse-generator-utility}</div><div class="line"><a name="l00339"></a><span class="lineno">  339</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00340"></a><span class="lineno">  340</span>&#160;The pulse generator used for testing is a small program that is installed along with PPS-Client.
