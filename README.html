The data below was captured over a 24 hour period from a Raspberry Pi running Raspian with a 4.4.14-v7+ kernel. Figure 1 is a distribution of time adjustments made by the pps-client controller to the system clock. </p><center><img src="/images/offset-distrib.png" alt="Jitter and Corrections Distrib" style="width: 608px;"/></center><p>Figure 2 shows the system clock frequency set by the controller which held the Allan deviation of the frequency to less than 20 parts per billion in each minute over the same period. This corresponds to a time drift of less than 20 nanoseconds per second (A clock offset of 1 ppm corresponds to a time drift of 1 microsec per sec.) The controller adjusted the frequency offset against temperature changes to the value that kept the system clock synchronized to the PPS within a fraction of a microsecond.</p><center><img src="/images/frequency-vars.png" alt="Frequency Vars over 24 hours" style="width: 685px;"/></center><p>The combination of time slew adjustments never exceeding 1 microsecond each second and time drift never exceeding 20 nanoseconds each second demonstrates a timekeeping control precision of 1 microsecond over this 24 hour period. Average absolute accuracy is only slightly worse. The practical limitation to accurate time measurement at any instant in time is clock oscillator jitter which typically has a standard deviation of about 2 microseconds.</p><h1 id="HardwareRequirements">Hardware Requirements</h1><hr/><ol><li>A Raspberry Pi 2 Model B or later.</li></ol><ol><li>A GPS module that provides a PPS output.

Copy the appropriate one to the RPi and run it from a terminal:

$ sudo ./pps-client-4.4.14-v7+
<code>`</code>
The pps-client version must match the version of the Linux kernel on the RPi. The kernel version can be determined by running "<code>uname -r</code>" on an RPi terminal. Version matching is necessary because pps-client contains a kernel driver and all kernel drivers are compiled against a specific version of the Linux kernel and can only run on that kernel version.</p><p>A few different Linux kernels are currently supported and more will be. This is not an ideal solution because it means that pps-client has to be re-installed if the kernel version is updated. fortunately that will not happen unless you run "<code>sudo rpi-update</code>". However, kernel development is proceeding very rapidly right now. Noticeable improvements occur from release to release. Our experience has been that is worthwhile to keep the kernel updated. The hope is that if there is enough interest in this project, the driver will be accepted into mainline in the upstream kernel and the version problem will go away.</p><h1 id="Uninstalling">Uninstalling</h1><hr/><p>Uninstall pps-client on the RPi with:

# Reinstalling

<code>`</code>
$ sudo mv /ect/pps-client.conf /etc/pps-client.conf.orig
<code>`</code>
and then, after installing pps-client,
<code>`</code>
$ sudo mv /etc/pps-client.conf.orig  /ect/pps-client.conf

# Building from Source
---
Because pps-client contains a Linux kernel driver, building pps-client requires that a compiled Linux kernel with the same version as the version present on the RPi must also be available during the compilation of pps-client. The pps-client project can be built directly on the RPi or on a Linux workstation with a cross-compiler. Building on the RPi is slower but more reliable. In either case you will first need to download and compile the Linux kernel that corresponds to the kernel version on your RPi.</p><p>The steps below don't do a complete kernel installation. Only enough is done to get the object files that are necessary for compiling a kernel driver. If you are unable to match your kernel version to the source found <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">here</a> instructions for doing a complete kernel install can be found <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md">here</a>. Otherwise follow the steps below.</p><p>If you need git:
<code>`</code>
$ sudo apt-get install git
<code>`</code></p><h2 id="LocatetheKernelSource">Locate the Kernel Source</h2><p>First determine the Linux kernel version on your RPi with "<code>uname -r</code>". Then from a browser go to https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux. Look at the <code>makefile</code> in the files list. The merge comment will give the version, <code>Linux 4.4.14</code>, at the time this was written. If this agrees with the version of your RPi you have the kernel source page you need. </p><p>If the Linux version is more recent, browse to https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commits/rpi-4.4.y. Search down though the commit list until you find the commit for the Linux version of your RPi. Select its commit number. That will take you to a the commit page. Select the <code>Browse Files</code> button at the top right. That will open the source tree page that you need. Copy its URL. For example, https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tree/ba760d4302e4fce130007b8bdbce7fcafc9bd9a9 , is the kernel source page for <code>Linux 4.4.13</code>.</p><h2 id="BuildingontheRPi">Building on the RPi</h2><p>You might want to create a folder to hold the kernel and pps-client project. For example,
<code>`</code>
$ mkdir ~/rpi
$ cd ~/rpi
<code>`</code>
Download the version of the kernel sources corresponding to your RPi as described above in "Locate the Kernel Source", substituting the appropriate source page:
<code>`</code>
$ git clone --depth=1 [your-rpi-kernel-source-page]
<code>`</code>
Get missing dependencies:
<code>`</code>
$ sudo apt-get install bc
<code>`</code>
Configure the kernel:
<code>`</code>
$ cd linux
$ KERNEL=kernel7
$ make bcm2709_defconfig
<code>`</code>
Compile the kernel (takes about half an hour):
<code>`</code>
$ make -j4 zImage
<code>`</code>
That will provide the necessary kernel object files to build the pps-client driver. If you have not already downloaded the pps-client project, do it now:
<code>`</code>
$ cd ..
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/rascol/PPS-Client
$ cd PPS-Client
<code>`</code>
Now (assuming that the kernel source version is 4.4.14) make the pps-client project. The <code>KERNELDIR</code> argument must point to the folder containing the compiled Linux kernel. If not, change it to point to the correct location of the "linux" folder.
<code>`</code>
$ make KERNELDIR=~/rpi/linux KERNELVERS=4.4.14-v7+
<code>`</code>
That will build the installer, <code>pps-client-4.4.14-v7+</code>. Run it on the RPi as root:
<code>`</code>
$ sudo ./pps-client-4.4.14-v7+
<code>`</code>
That completes the pps-client installation.</p><h2 id="BuildingonaLinuxWorkstation">Building on a Linux Workstation</h2><p>This is decidedly for the adventurous. We've had problems with the cross-compiler where it looked like everything was fine but the code didn't run on the RPi. Very hard to debug. On the other hand, it can be much easier to get code though the compile stage on a workstation.</p><p>You might want to create a folder to hold the kernel and tools. For example,
<code>`</code>
$ mkdir ~/rpi
$ cd ~/rpi
<code>`</code>
On a workstation you will need the cross-compiler:
<code>`</code>
$ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools
<code>`</code>
That should create a <code>tools</code> folder in <code>/rpi</code>.</p><p>Download the version of the kernel sources corresponding to your RPi as described above in "Locate the Kernel Source", substituting the appropriate source page:
<code>`</code>
$ git clone --depth=1 [your-rpi-kernel-source-page]
<code>`</code>
This environment variable will be needed both to configure the kernel and to build pps-client:
<code>`</code>
$ export CROSS_COMPILE=~/rpi/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-
<code>`</code>
The <code>export</code> command above is temporary. It will survive only until you close the terminal window. To make it persistent you can optionally add the <code>export</code> command to the <code>.bashrc</code> file in your home directory.</p><p>Now configure the kernel:
<code>`</code>
$ cd linux
$ KERNEL=kernel7
$ make ARCH=arm CROSS<em>COMPILE=$CROSS</em>COMPILE bcm2709_defconfig
<code>`</code>
and compile it:
<code>`</code>
$ make -j6 ARCH=arm CROSS<em>COMPILE=$CROSS</em>COMPILE zImage
<code>`</code>
That will provide the necessary kernel object files to build the driver. If you have not already downloaded the pps-client project, do it now:
<code>`</code>
$ cd ~/rpi
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/rascol/PPS-Client
$ cd PPS-Client
<code>`</code>
Now (assuming that the kernel source version is 4.4.14) make the pps-client project. The <code>KERNELDIR</code> argument must point to the folder containing the compiled Linux kernel. If not, change it to point to the correct location of the "linux" folder.
<code>`</code>
$ make CROSS<em>COMPILE=$CROSS</em>COMPILE KERNELDIR=~/rpi/linux KERNELVERS=4.4.14-v7+
<code>`</code>
That will build the installer, <code>pps-client-4.4.14-v7+</code>. Copy this to the RPi. Run it on the RPi as root:
<code>`</code>
$ sudo ./pps-client-4.4.14-v7+
<code>`</code>
That completes the pps-client installation.</p><h1 id="Runningppsclient">Running pps-client</h1><hr/><p>The pps-client requires that a PPS hardware signal is available from a GPS module. Once the GPS is connected and the PPS output is present on GPIO 4 you can do a quick try-out with,
<code>`</code>
$ sudo pps-client
<code>`</code>
That installs pps-client as a daemon. To watch the controller acquire you can subsequently enter
<code>`</code>
$ pps-client -v
<code>`</code>
That runs a secondary copy of pps-client that just displays a status printout that the pps-client daemon continuously generates. When pps-client starts up you can expect to see something like the following in the status printout:</p><center><img src="/images/StatusPrintoutOnStart.png" alt="Status Printout on Startup" style="width: 634px;"/></center><p>The <code>jitter</code> value is showing the fractional second offset of the PPS signal according to the system clock. That value will decrease second by second as the controller locks to the PPS signal. After about 10 minutes the status printout will look like this:</p><center><img src="/images/StatusPrintoutAt10Min.png" alt="Status Printout after 10 Min" style="width: 634px;"/></center><p>The <code>jitter</code> is displaying small numbers. The time of the rising edge of the PPS signal is shown in the second column. The <code>clamp</code> value on the far right indicates that the maximum time correction applied to the system clock is being limited to one microsecond. The system clock is synchronized to the PPS signal to a precision of one microsecond.</p><p>It can take as long as 20 minutes for pps-client to fully acquire the first time it runs. This happens if the <code>jitter</code> shown in the status printout is on the order of 100,000 microseconds or more. It's quite common for the NTP fractional second to be off by that amount. In this case pps-client may restart several times as it slowly reduces the <code>jitter</code> offset. That happens because system functions that pps-client calls internally prevent time changes of more than about 500 microseconds in each second.</p><p>These are the parameters shown in the status printout:</p><ul><li>First two columns - date and time of the rising edge of the PPS signal.</li><li>Third column - the total number of PPS interrupts received since pps-client was started.</li><li>jitter - the time deviation in microseconds recorded at the reception of the PPS interrupt.</li><li>freqOffset - the frequency offset of the system clock in parts per million of the system clock frequency.</li><li>avgCorrection - the time corrections (in microseconds) averaged over the previous minute.</li><li>clamp - the hard limit (in microsecs) applied to the raw time error to convert it to a time correction.</li></ul><p>Every sixth line, interrupt delay parameters are also shown. About every 17 minutes, an SNTP time query will be made and the results of that will be shown, but will have no effect unless a time update is required.</p><p>To stop the display type ctrl-c.</p><p>The daemon will continue to run until you reboot the system or until you stop the daemon with
<code>`</code>
$ sudo pps-client-stop
<code>`</code></p><p>To have the pps-client daemon be installed as a system service and loaded on system boot, from an RPi terminal enter:
<code>`</code>
$ sudo chkconfig --add pps-client
<code>`</code>
If you have installed pps-client as a system service you should start it with 
<code>`</code>
$ sudo service pps-client start
<code>`</code>
and you should stop it with
<code>`</code>
$ sudo service pps-client stop
<code>`</code>
The "<code>pps-client -v</code>" command continues to work as described above.</p><p>If your have questions, we have answers. Be sure to check out the docs.</p></body></html>
