# pps-client.conf v1.0.0
# The configuration file for pps-client. With the exception of hardware calibration,
# can be used to change a configuration before or while pps-client is running. These 
# are the current config settings, each prefaced with a short description:

# Saves a distribution of the accumulated system clock time corrections made each
# second to /var/local/pps-error-distrib-forming which is transfered every 24 hours
# to /var/local/pps-error-distrib. Defaults to error-distrib=disable.
#error-distrib=enable
#error-distrib=disable

# Saves a distribution of the accumulated jitter recorded each second to
# /var/local/pps-jitter-distrib-forming which is transfered every 24 hours   
# to /var/local/pps-jitter-distrib. Defaults to jitter-distrib=disable.
#jitter-distrib=enable
#jitter-distrib=disable

# Enables a hardware output pin that is set high on loss of the PPS interrupt and is
# cleared low when the PPS interrupt resumes. Defaults to alert-pps-lost=disable.
#alert-pps-lost=enable
#alert-pps-lost=disable

# Allows pps-client to exit after the PPS interrupt is lost for one hour. If disabled, 
# pps-client holds the system clock frequency offset at the last update value but does 
# not automatically exit. Defaults to exit-lost-pps=enable.
#exit-lost-pps=enable
#exit-lost-pps=disable

# Enables hardware calibration when the two GPIO pins indentified in the pps-client.c 
# kernel driver source file are wired together. Defaults to calibrate=disable. Must  
# be set before pps-client runs. Has no effect while pps-client is running.
#calibrate=enable

# If calibrate=disable, a static value for sysDelay can be assigned here. This is not 
# necessary for Raspberry Pi 3 which already has an assigned default value for sysDelay.
#sysdelay-value=6

# If calibrate=enable, can save a distribution of interrupt delay values accumulated
# at one second intervals to /var/local/pps-intrpt-distrib-forming which is transferred
# to /var/local/pps-intrpt-distrib every 24 hours. Defaults to interrupt-distrib=disable.
#interrupt-distrib=enable
#interrupt-distrib=disable

# If calibrate=enable, can save a distribution of sysDelay values accumulated at one
# second intervals to /var/local/pps-sysDelay-distrib-forming which is transferred to
# /var/local/pps-sysDelay-distrib every 24 hours. Defaults to sysdelay-distrib=disable.
#sysdelay-distrib=enable
#sysdelay-distrib=disable

# Shows the remove noise parameters once a minute as part of the pps-client status 
# display. Defaults to show-remove-noise=disable.
#show-remove-noise=enable
#show-remove-noise=disable
