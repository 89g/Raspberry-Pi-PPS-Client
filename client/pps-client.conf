# pps-client.conf v1.3.0
# The configuration file for PPS-Client. These settings can be used to change
# a configuration before or while PPS-Client is running. Each configuration 
# is prefaced with a short description:

# Saves a distribution of the accumulated system clock time corrections made each
# second to /var/local/pps-error-distrib-forming which is transfered every 24 hours
# to /var/local/pps-error-distrib. Defaults to error-distrib=disable.
#error-distrib=enable
#error-distrib=disable

# Saves a distribution of the accumulated jitter recorded each second to
# /var/local/pps-jitter-distrib-forming which is transfered every 24 hours   
# to /var/local/pps-jitter-distrib. Defaults to jitter-distrib=disable.
#jitter-distrib=enable
#jitter-distrib=disable

# Enables a hardware output pin that is set high on loss of the PPS interrupt and is
# cleared low when the PPS interrupt resumes. Defaults to alert-pps-lost=disable.
#alert-pps-lost=enable
#alert-pps-lost=disable

# Allows PPS-Client to exit after the PPS interrupt is lost for one hour. If disabled, 
# PPS-Client holds the system clock frequency offset at the last update value but does 
# not automatically exit. Defaults to exit-lost-pps=enable.
#exit-lost-pps=enable
#exit-lost-pps=disable

# Can save a distribution of interrupt delay values accumulated at one second intervals 
# to /var/local/pps-intrpt-distrib-forming which is transferred to /var/local/pps-intrpt-distrib 
# every 24 hours. Defaults to interrupt-distrib=disable.
#interrupt-distrib=enable
#interrupt-distrib=disable

# Can save a distribution of sysDelay values accumulated at one second intervals to
# /var/local/pps-sysDelay-distrib-forming which is transferred to /var/local/pps-sysDelay-distrib 
# every 24 hours. Defaults to sysdelay-distrib=disable.
#sysdelay-distrib=enable
#sysdelay-distrib=disable

# Input and output pins on the RPi processors are identified by GPIO numbers. These GPIO numbers 
# are set in the PPS-Client driver (gps-pps-io.ko) to determine the processor pin that is used
# for the PPS signal (pps-gpio), and the pins that are used for self calibration (output-gpio and 
# intrpt-gpio). These GPIO assignments (and the pins they determine) can be changed by assigning 
# different GPIO values. These GPIO assignments are determined exclusively by this file. The 
# values given below are the default values and should not be changed unless there are conflicts 
# with other uses of the GPIO pins.
#
# These GPIO assignments are read only when PPS-Client starts and just before the driver loads.

pps-gpio=4
output-gpio=17
intrpt-gpio=22

# If you want to use a program other than SNTP to set the wall-clock time of day, 
# SNTP can be disabled to allow the external program to be used. Defaults to sntp=enable.
#sntp=enable
#sntp=disable
